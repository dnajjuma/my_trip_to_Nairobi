    Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.
Usage: <br>

    Clone the repository to your local machine.

    To mark a task as completed, click on the checkbox next to the task.
    To delete a task, click on the delete button next to the task.
    Use the filter options at the top to filter tasks by their completion status.
